# Fashion Designs Generation with Generative Adversial Network using Keras and the Fashion-MNIST dataset
In this notebook, we will see how to generate fashion designs from nothing more than noise. We will use a generative adversial network with the help of Keras library and train it on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
